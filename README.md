## What is a Text-Based Adventure Game

A Text-Based Adventure Game is a type of game in which a player has to make choices (Yes / No) in every step of the game.
Based on these choices, the storyline changes, and at last, we get to know that whether the player wins or loses the game.

## Storyline

Here is a diagram that will help you in better understanding the storyline of our game:

As you can see from the above diagram that at the starting of the story, a man came to us and ask for shelter.

Now, you get the two options to choose from, which is saying Yes or No to the man.

So, if you said yes, then after 2 minutes, the police will come to your house and will ask you whether the thief is inside or not.

Now again, you have two options, which is saying Yes or No to the police.

So, if you said Yes, then you will win the game. As the man who was asking for shelter is a thief. On the other hand, if you said no, then you will go to Jail and your Game is Over.

However, At the starting of the story, if you said “no” to the man who is asking for shelter. Then he will attack you.

Now, again you have 2 options, which is knocking him down or not.

So, if you knock him down, then you will win the game. Otherwise, he will kill you and you will lose the game.
Now that you understand the storyline of our game. 

## Understanding the Code Above

In the first line of this code, we have used the List Variable for storing all the combinations of saying Yes.

Similarly, In the second line of this code, we have used another List Variable to store all the combinations of saying No.

In the next line, we have printed the intro of our game. Then we asked the user to type Yes or No with the help of input() in Python.

So, if the user type Yes, then the code inside the if block will get executed.

On the other hand, if the user type No, then the code inside the elif block will get executed.

At last, if the user types some wrong input, then the code inside the else block will get executed.

It may be multiple cases.
